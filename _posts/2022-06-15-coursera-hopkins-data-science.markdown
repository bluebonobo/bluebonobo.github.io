The Coursera Johns Hopkins Data Science specialization consists of 10 courses followed by a capstone project. I describe here the process, resources, artefacts and submission for this project. See details [here](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-science-project)

## Few words about the Capstone project   
In partnership with a corporate partner Swiftkey, the goal is to build a smart keyboard that makes it easier for people to type. One cornerstone of their smart keyboard is predictive text models (equivalent to autofill for next word). Developing basic understanding of Natural Language processing and Text Mining is required

## Understanding the problem
We download the capstone dataset which consists of 3 text files containing respectively tweats, blogs and news text. The dataset covers 4 languages : English, Russian, Finish and German. Size of the dataset is around 600MB.

## Familiarization with NLP
As a first step toward working on this project, you should familiarize yourself with Natural Language Processing, Text Mining, and the associated tools in R.

### how to load the dataset in R?


### Questions to consider

1. What do the data look like?
2. Where do the data come from?
3. Can you think of any other data sources that might help you in this project?
4. What are the common steps in natural language processing?
5. What are some common issues in the analysis of text data?
6. What is the relationship between NLP and the concepts you have learned in the Specialization?
