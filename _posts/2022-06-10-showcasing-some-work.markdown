The Coursera Johns Hopkins Data Science specialization calls for submission of various data science project analysis and presentations. I have hosted some of these on this github account. Here are a few of these assets.

## Practical Machine Learning Course  

For the Practical Machine Learning course, the students were asked to analyze a dataset from the Quantified Self Movement. The work can be found [here on Github](https://bluebonobo.github.io/coursera_hopkins_practicalmachinelearning/)

To summarize the work : After exploring, visualizing and cleaning the data, I train 3 models suited for a classifiation problem (Decision Tree Model, Gradient Boost Model, and Tree Bag). I perform a kfold cross validation when training each model. After comparing the accuracy and confusion matrices for each model, the TreeBag model performs best and I decide to proceed to the predition part of the assignmnent using the Treebag model

The data for this project come from [this source](http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har). At time of submiting the assignment this link is not working, we found [this link](https://perceptualui.org/publications/velloso13_ah.pdf) instead

#### more about decision tree 


#### more about gradient boost


#### more about bagging tree bag


## Develop Data Products Course

The course can be found [here](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-products).  
The shiny application developed can be found [here](https://bluebonobo.shinyapps.io/week4shinyapp/). It is hosted by RStudio on shinyapps.io

>A data product is the production output from a statistical analysis. Data products automate complex analysis tasks or use technology to expand the utility of a data informed model, algorithm or inference. This course covers the basics of creating data products using Shiny, R packages, and interactive graphics. The course will focus on the fundamentals of creating a data product that can be used to tell a story about data to a mass audience. 

Course content 

1. Shiny, rCharts, manipulate, googleVis 
2. Presenting data analysis, slidify, R Studio presenter. 
3. Students creating and deploying their projects 
4. Creating R packages, classes and methods.
