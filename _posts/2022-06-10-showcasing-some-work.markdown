The Coursera Johns Hopkins Data Science specialization calls for submission of various data science project analysis and presentations. I have hosted some of these on this github. Here are a few of these assets.

# Practical Machine Learning Assignment  

For the Practical Machine Learning course, the students were asked to analyze a dataset from the Quantified Self Movement. The work can be found [here on Github](https://bluebonobo.github.io/coursera_hopkins_practicalmachinelearning/)

To summarize the work : After exploring, visualizing and cleaning the data, I train 3 models suited for a classifiation problem (Decision Tree Model, Gradient Boost Model, and Tree Bag). I perform a kfold cross validation when training each model. After comparing the accuracy and confusion matrices for each model, the TreeBag model performs best and I decide to proceed to the predition part of the assignmnent using the Treebag model

The data for this project come from [this source](http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har). At time of submiting the assignment this link is not working, we found [this link](https://perceptualui.org/publications/velloso13_ah.pdf) instead
