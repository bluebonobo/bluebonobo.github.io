In this course, we are looking at ways and formats available to present data science analysis and presentations. These are refered to as Data Products. The course exclusively uses the R language and R Studio plateform. 

Additionaly, We also describe how python and jupyter are used to produce data products

## Locally
I found that installing Jupyter Extension on VSCode and running the notebook directly on VSCode

## [Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/) in browser Python from Google

With Colab you can harness the full power of popular Python libraries to analyze and visualize data. The code cell below uses numpy to generate some random data, and uses matplotlib to visualize it. To edit the code, just click the cell and start editing.
With Colab you can import an image dataset, train an image classifier on it, and evaluate the model, all in just a few lines of code. Colab notebooks execute code on Google's cloud servers, meaning you can leverage the power of Google hardware, including GPUs and TPUs, regardless of the power of your machine. All you need is a browser.
